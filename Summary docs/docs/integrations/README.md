# Integrations

Symflowise.ai is designed to seamlessly connect with a wide array of third-party systems, ensuring that it complements your existing technology stack and enhances your operational workflows. These integrations are crucial for providing a holistic view of customer interactions, automating processes, and empowering your teams.

## CRM Integrations

Integrating Symflowise.ai with your Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system provides a unified view of customer data, enabling personalized interactions and efficient issue resolution. Key CRM integrations include:

### Salesforce

This integration allows for bidirectional data synchronization between Symflowise.ai and Salesforce. Customer profiles, case histories, and interaction logs from Symflowise.ai can be automatically updated in Salesforce, while agents using Symflowise.ai gain real-time access to Salesforce data like contact details, lead status, and opportunity information. This enriches customer context, streamlines workflows by eliminating manual data entry, and supports sales and support alignment.

### HubSpot

Connect Symflowise.ai with HubSpot to automate lead capturing and activity logging. Interactions within Symflowise.ai, such as new leads generated from chat or support requests, can create or update contacts in HubSpot. Furthermore, support activities and communication history can be logged against customer records in HubSpot, providing a complete lifecycle view and enabling targeted marketing and sales follow-ups.

### Zendesk

Integrating with Zendesk allows Symflowise.ai to create, update, and manage Zendesk tickets directly from our platform. AI and human agents can access existing ticket information, customer history, and support SLAs stored in Zendesk. This ensures that all support interactions are centralized, improves agent productivity by providing a unified interface, and leverages Zendesk's robust ticketing capabilities within automated Symflowise.ai workflows.

### ServiceNow

The ServiceNow integration focuses on IT Service Management (ITSM) and customer service management workflows. Symflowise.ai can create or update incidents, problems, or service requests in ServiceNow based on user interactions. This is particularly beneficial for resolving IT support issues or managing customer service cases that require backend-fulfillment through ServiceNow, ensuring end-to-end process automation and visibility.

## Messaging Integrations

Real-time communication and collaboration are enhanced by integrating Symflowise.ai with popular messaging platforms.

### Microsoft Teams

This integration enables Symflowise.ai to send real-time notifications and alerts to specific channels or individuals within Microsoft Teams. For example, supervisors can be alerted to escalations, or teams can receive updates on critical ticket statuses. It can also facilitate internal collaboration on complex customer issues, allowing agents to quickly seek assistance from subject matter experts within Teams.

### Slack

Similar to the Microsoft Teams integration, connecting with Slack allows Symflowise.ai to push timely notifications and alerts into designated Slack channels or to individual users. This keeps relevant team members informed of important events, such as system alerts, urgent customer queries, or workflow approval requests, fostering rapid response and efficient internal communication.

## Knowledge Base Integrations (User-Side Knowledgebase)

Symflowise.ai can connect to a multitude of knowledge sources to provide comprehensive information to AI agents, human agents, and directly to end-users. This ensures that answers are consistent, accurate, and readily available.

### General Knowledge Source Connectors

Our platform offers connectors for a wide range of popular content repositories and collaboration tools. These include, but are not limited to: Asana, Box, Confluence, Dropbox, Egnyte, Figma, Freshservice, GDrive, GitLab, GitHub, Gmail, Gong, Google Groups, Google Sites, Greenhouse, Guru, Jira, Lumapps, Looker, Miro, Microsoft Teams (for its content repositories), Notion, OneDrive, Outlook, and Salesforce (for its knowledge articles). Integrating these sources allows Symflowise.ai to ingest and leverage a vast amount of organizational knowledge, significantly improving the accuracy and scope of AI-driven responses and providing human agents with powerful search capabilities across disparate systems.

### Specific Use Case: Confluence & Jira

A primary use case for knowledge base integration involves Confluence and Jira. By connecting to Confluence, Symflowise.ai's AI can access and learn from articles, FAQs, and technical documentation to provide accurate answers to user queries. Integration with Jira allows the AI to fetch information about specific issues, ticket statuses, or development progress, enabling it to provide real-time updates to customers or inform support agents. This combination ensures that both structured (Jira) and unstructured (Confluence) knowledge is effectively utilized.

## Telephony Platforms

Integration with various telephony platforms is essential for enabling voice interactions within Symflowise.ai. This allows for features such as Interactive Voice Response (IVR) powered by our conversational AI, intelligent call routing to the appropriate AI or human agent, and seamless call transfer capabilities. The integration ensures that voice interactions are logged, transcribed (if needed), and managed within the Symflowise.ai ecosystem, providing an omnichannel experience. Specific platform connectors are configured during deployment based on client infrastructure.

## Payment Processing Integration

To facilitate transactions directly within chat or voice interactions, Symflowise.ai can integrate with secure payment processing gateways. This allows customers to perform actions like making payments, updating billing information, or subscribing to services under PCI-DSS compliant conditions. The integration streamlines the payment process, reduces manual effort for agents, and enhances the customer experience by offering convenient, in-channel payment options.

## LMS/CMS Integration

Symflowise.ai can integrate with Learning Management Systems (LMS) and Content Management Systems (CMS) to enhance agent training and content delivery. For LMS integration, this means agent performance data from Symflowise.ai can inform training paths in the LMS, and training completion can unlock new capabilities within Symflowise.ai. CMS integration allows for dynamic content sourcing for AI responses or agent knowledge KBs, ensuring that information provided through Symflowise.ai is consistent with official content managed in the CMS.
