## Deployment Overview

This section outlines the initial steps for deploying the platform, focusing on the landing front view.

6. **Monitor Performance:**
   * Use monitoring tools to track loading times, uptime, and user interactions on the landing page.
   * Gather feedback from early users to identify potential improvements.
7. **Regular Updates:**
   * Schedule periodic reviews for updates and improvements based on new features or user feedback.
   * Ensure the landing page content remains relevant and up-to-date.



This is the beginning for the Platform when I land.
