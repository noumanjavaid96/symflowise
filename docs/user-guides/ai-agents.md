# AI Agents (Automated Interaction Flow)

*   **Initiation/Engagement:**
    *   Automatically engages on customer initiation (call, chat, form submission).
*   **Key Interactions & Touchpoints:**
    *   Uses NLU (Gemini) to understand customer intent.
    *   Accesses knowledge bases and integrated systems for answers.
    *   Provides responses (TTS for voice, text for chat).
    *   Manages conversation context and performs real-time sentiment analysis.
    *   Filters spam.
*   **Decision Points & Potential Paths:**
    *   **Resolve Query:** Successfully resolves. -> Interaction ends.
    *   **Escalate to Human Agent:** If complex, sentiment is negative, or user requests. Transfers context.
    *   **Compliance Review:** AI responses may go to human review in regulated industries.
*   **Tools/Features Interacted With:**
    *   NLU/NLP (Gemini), STT/TTS, knowledge base APIs, sentiment analysis engine, spam detection, escalation workflows, CRM data access.
*   **Typical Outcome/Goal:**
    *   Resolve Tier-1 inquiries automatically (call deflection).
    *   Provide 24/7 instant responses.
    *   Accurately identify need for human escalation and gather context.
